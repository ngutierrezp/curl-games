## 📝 Description

Space Shooter for Bash is a modernized terminal arcade game. It includes window size detection, animated effects, and a fun, challenging experience using only Bash.

- **Goal:** Destroy as many enemies as possible before they reach the ground. Each enemy destroyed gives you points.
- **Lives:** You have 3 lives. If an enemy reaches the ground, you lose a life and see an "IMPACT!!" warning.
- **Win:** Reach the target score to win (default: 100,000 points). The enemy speed increases as your score grows!
- **Infinite Mode:** Play endlessly for a high score (select from the main menu).
